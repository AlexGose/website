Title: About Me 
Slug: about

I am an independent researcher with a passion for learning who is currently transitioning to a career as an operations research and data scientist.  I'm seeking to apply my skills to provide objective insights into optimal business operations.

After graduating with a PhD in Operations Research from North Carolina State University, I co-authored peer-reviewed academic papers in some of the top publications in the field of Operations Research.  Upon graduation, I took the opportunity to have the freedom and time to explore what I wanted to research and learn. 

Prior to being an independent researcher, I held a number of positions.  I worked as a graduate research assistant when I was a PhD student.  I was an Operations Research Analyst at Intel Corporation while working on my dissertation dealing with semiconductor manufacturing and decision making under uncertainty.  I was also an Operations Research Analyst for a consulting firm in the defense industry, where I worked for clients in the Navy, Air Force, Homeland Security, and NASA.  

I have a BA in Physics and BS in Mathematics from the University of Cincinnati.  I have received a number of awards during my academic career, including merit-based scholarships, fellowships, and assistantships, which funded my undergraduate and graduate education.  I also received two Outstanding Team Service awards while working in consulting.  I'm a member of the NCSU Alumni Association.
